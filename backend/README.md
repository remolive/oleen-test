This is a plain ruby app, you might need ruby 3.2.2 to run it

## Usage

```bash
ruby main.rb
```

You can change program params directly from the main script :
```
	params = {
		"duration": 30,
		"preparation": 5,
		"from": "2021-03-01T00:00:00Z",
		"to": "2021-03-08T00:00:00Z",
	}
```

## Notes

This script need some improvements, like refactoring and lisibility in the `WorkingPlanning` class but it has not been done due to lack of time.
